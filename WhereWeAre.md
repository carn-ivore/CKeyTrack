Sure! Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of the changes made, the current state of your application, and the necessary code and spreadsheet layout to remind you where you are.

### Current State Overview

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - The `KeySelect` component fetches available keys based on a user PIN.
   - The component uses `axios` to make a POST request to the backend.
   - The keys are displayed as clickable squares in the UI.

2. **Backend (Express)**
   - The Express server is set up to handle CORS and parse JSON requests.
   - Routes are defined for user authentication and fetching available keys.
   - The API successfully returns available keys when tested with Postman.

### Changes Made

1. **Express Server Configuration (`app.js`)**
   - Added CORS middleware to allow requests from the React frontend.
   - Included `express.json()` middleware to parse incoming JSON request bodies.
   - Added optional logging middleware to log incoming request bodies for debugging.

   **Updated `app.js` Code:**
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cors = require('cors');
   require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env file

   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

   // Use CORS middleware
   app.use(cors({
     origin: 'http://localhost:3000', // Allow requests from your React frontend
   }));

   // Middleware to parse JSON requests
   app.use(express.json()); // This is essential for parsing JSON request bodies

   // Import routes
   const { router: authRouter } = require('./backend/routes/authRoutes');
   const availableKeysRoute = require('./backend/routes/availableKeysRoutes');

   // Log the imported router for debugging
   console.log('Auth Router:', authRouter);

   // Use routes
   app.use('/login', authRouter);
   app.use('/available-keys', availableKeysRoute);

   // Optional: Middleware to log incoming requests (for debugging)
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Request Body:', req.body); // Log the request body
     next();
   });

   // Start the server
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

2. **KeySelect Component (`KeySelect.js`)**
   - The component fetches available keys based on the user PIN and displays them.
   - Added logging to check the response from the API and the available keys.

   **KeySelect.js Code:**
   ```javascript
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import axios from 'axios';
   import './KeySelect.css'; // Import the CSS file

   const KeySelect = ({ user, setView, setSelectedKey }) => {
       const [availableKeys, setAvailableKeys] = useState([]);

       useEffect(() => {
           const fetchAvailableKeys = async () => {
               try {
                   const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/available-keys', { pin: user.pin });
                   console.log('Response:', response.data); // Log the entire response
                   setAvailableKeys(response.data.availableKeys); // Adjust this line if the structure is different
               } catch (error) {
                   console.error('Error fetching available keys:', error);
               }
           };
           fetchAvailableKeys();
       }, [user.pin]);

       useEffect(() => {
           console.log('Updated Available Keys:', availableKeys); // Log available keys whenever they change
       }, [availableKeys]);

       return (
           <div className="container">
               <h2>Select a Key</h2>
               {availableKeys.map((key, index) => (
                   <div
                       key={index}
                       className="key"
                       onClick={() => {
                           setSelectedKey(key);
                           setView('ConfirmPage');
                       }}
                   >
                       {key}
                   </div>
               ))}
           </div>
       );
   };

   export default KeySelect;
   ```

3. **Spreadsheet Layout**
   - **Spreadsheet Document Name**: CKeyTrack Spreadsheet
   - **Sheet: employeeInfoSheet**
     ```
     eID | firstName | lastName | PIN
     1   | Brent     | Brent    | 1234
     2   | Aaron     | Aaron    | 2234
     ```

   - **Sheet: keyInfoSheet**
     ```
     keyID | keyName | Description
     1     | P.1     | Primus - Great Grand Master
     2     | AA.1    | AA - Grand Master
     3     | AA.2    | AA - Grand Master
     ```

   - **Sheet: authorizedKeysSheet**
     ```
     eID | keyID | authorizationExpiration
     1   | 1     | 2025-08-01 11:30
  ```

- **Sheet: checkOutInSheet**
  ```
  transactionID | eID | keyID | checkOutTimestamp     | checkInTimestamp
  1              | 1   | 1     | 2025-02-10 08:00      | 
  ```

### Summary of Where We Are

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - The `KeySelect` component is set up to fetch available keys based on a user PIN.
   - The component successfully displays the keys as clickable squares.
   - The API call to fetch keys works correctly when tested with Postman, returning the expected keys.

2. **Backend (Express)**
   - The Express server is configured to handle CORS and parse JSON request bodies.
   - Routes for user authentication and fetching available keys are defined and functioning.
   - The server logs incoming requests and responses for debugging purposes.

3. **Data Flow**
   - The user enters a PIN in the frontend, which is sent to the backend.
   - The backend checks the PIN against the `employeeInfoSheet` in the Google Sheets.
   - If the PIN is valid, it retrieves the authorized keys and checks their availability based on the `checkOutInSheet`.
   - The available keys are sent back to the frontend, where they are displayed to the user.

### Next Steps

1. **Debugging**: If you encounter any issues with the frontend not displaying the keys, ensure that the `user.pin` is correctly passed to the `KeySelect` component and that the API response structure matches what you expect.

2. **Testing**: Continue testing the application by entering different PINs and verifying that the correct keys are displayed based on the data in the Google Sheets.

3. **Enhancements**: Consider adding error handling in the UI to inform users if no keys are available or if there is an issue with the PIN.

4. **Deployment**: Once everything is working as expected, you can look into deploying your backend and frontend applications.
